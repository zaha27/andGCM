# andGCM â€“ AI Git Commit Assistant

Transform Git commit messages into professional, automated sentences generated directly from your code changes.

A command-line virtual assistant powered by artificial intelligence, designed to help developers generate meaningful Git commit messages automatically.  
andGCM uses **Ollama**, a local LLM (Large Language Model), to understand your code changes and produce accurate, context-aware commit messages.  
It also helps you understand the most commonly used Git commands and ensures your commit history stays clean, readable, and professional.  
Think of it as your smart Git companion â€” right in the terminal.
